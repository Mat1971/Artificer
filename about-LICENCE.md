This is supposed to be a free hardware project.

I've stuck the CERN open hardware license (permissive) V2 on the root of this repository, because that seems a decent starting point and that's what FabMX uses, but there's probably a lot of different licenses required.

Voron stuff is typically GPL3 for example, and a lot of things here are remixed Voron parts.

I've set myself a vague personal limit of trying not to include anything less free than "creative commons attribution" as a source for anything I include or remix.

Some of the stuff I've stolen off grabcad has an unknown license, but in those cases the part is just for reference and isn't fundamental to the design.

If you own the license to a part we used, and object to that part being included, we will attempt to compy with your requests to remove it in a timely fashion.

I strongly prefer to be as free as possible, i.e. CC0 or public domain, MIT or BSD at worst, but the licenses of stuff we remix will set a lower bound on the level of freedom.

If you don't know or care about licenses, just license stuff you make from scratch under CCO or the included cern open hardware permissive V2 or both please.

If you do care, I will object to you trying to include something that is licensed under terms that restrict freedoms such as CC-NC, but otherwise I'm fairly laissez faire as long as it's "free".
