This is a 3D printer developed at Makespace in Cambridge.

It is primarily intended as a development platform for the FabMX extruder.

The goal is to deliver high precision motion when printing with a very heavy toolhead using affordable and readily-available parts.

We will steal as much as possible from other open hardware projects such as Voron.

The printer should have a build volume of at least 120mm cube. The printer must have a heated bed. Ideally, the printer should be enclosed. Water cooling of the extruder must be integrated. Print speed doesn't have to be world-beating but it would be nice if it was at least comparable to a modern, stock, "off the shelf" 3D printer such as a Voron 2.4.
