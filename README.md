# Artificer

This is a 3D printer developed at Makespace in Cambridge.

It is primarily intended as a development platform for the FabMX extruder.

The goal is to deliver high precision motion when printing with a very heavy toolhead using affordable and readily-available parts.

We will steal as much as possible from other open hardware projects such as Voron.
